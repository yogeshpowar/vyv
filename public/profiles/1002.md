### About Me ###

The power of managing and developing to a level where it has to be is always
spoken about. We have seen development & changes from time to time. Some
developments were good some needed more clarity. We still see lot of challenges
in new developments and need more contribution to develop further and make the
society a better place to stay. However, due to some or the other intervention
these new and good changes does not seems to be happening. I have been working
on social front and have developed a good rapport with residents, especially
ladies. I have been discussing several topics with them through Sakhi Manch in
and around Pimple Saudagar. I am looking forward to extend the help required to
all citizens and welcome new ideas, plans which can bring a positive change in
Pimple Saudagar - Rahatani area
