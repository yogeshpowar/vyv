### About Me ###

Why in Politics ?

Belonging from a cultural and an educated middle-class family have purposely
entered into politics. Because I am aware that as long as you don't enter
into politics the expected things won't happen, therefore,your co-operation
is needed also once again, I remind you that

I did not come into politics to change but

have come to change the politics....!!
