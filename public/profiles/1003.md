### About Me ###

I have come to believe that each of us has a personal calling that's as unique
as a fingerprint, and that the best way to succeed is to discover what you love
and then find a way to offer it to others in the form of service, working hard,
and also allowing the energy of the universe to lead you. I have a dream to work
tirelessly for the people, my society and nation without expectation and i
should help people in their problems and can be the reason for the smile on
their face, with this small dream in mind I am on the path with your support.
Thank you for electing me the corporator from Pimple Saudagar- Rahatani to live
my only dream to live for you all. I promise to be always there when you need
me. Thank you once again.
